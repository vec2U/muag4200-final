    This paper is about the game <i>Hyper Light Drifter,</i> developed by Heart Machine and released in 2016. I love this game to death, not least because of its landscape and soundscape. I never really nailed down what's so appealing about it to me,
    and what's driven me to uncover every little secret inside it when I'm usually not a completionist at all, until very recently. Upon being greeted with the world a third time when I started a new playthrough for this class, I realized it was <i>adventure.</i>

    This is one of the first things you're greeted with after the opening cutscene and the tutorial. It shows you the town in the distance, but more importantly it lets you feel what it's like to be a brave warrior standing on the edge of a cliff looking off into the distance.
    You almost feel heroic, even before you've really started the game!
