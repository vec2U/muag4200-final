    This paper is about the game <i>Hyper Light Drifter,</i> developed by Heart Machine and released in 2016. I love this game to death, not least because of its landscape and soundscape. I never really nailed down what's so appealing about it to me,
    and what's driven me to uncover every little secret inside it when I'm usually not a completionist at all, until very recently. Upon being greeted with the world a third time when I started a new playthrough for this class, I realized it was an overwhelming feeling of <i>adventure.</i>

    This is one of the first sights you're greeted with after the opening cutscene and the tutorial. It shows you the town in the distance, but more importantly it lets you feel what it's like to <i>be a brave warrior standing on the edge of a cliff looking off into the distance.</i>
    You almost feel heroic, even before you've really started the game!
  </p>

    After a killer cutscene where you're plagued by visions and rescued by a mysterious helmed hero, you wake up in their house and subsequently walk out into town. It's all a very cliched-sounding beginning of a hero's journey.
    The town is peaceful, and the buildings you can visit consist mostly of the shops where the inhabitants will sell you things later. Again, not a very creative-sounding setup! It's all in the sights and sounds that the game turns that conventional journey into a proper <i>adventure.</i>

    The game "hails" the player, as Althusser would say, in a plethora of ways, some very obvious and others more subtle. The region where you start the game leads you into a tutorial, which directly tells you what your controls are, but more importantly,
    the game indirectly signals that you are entering into a heroic video game escapade, and thus any prior video game escapades will apply. The town is full of shops; any walls blocking your path will have arrows on them telling you to "go that way first" or boxes telling you to "collect this many keys";
    interacting with a fellow traveler causes them to show you what the boss of the region looks like and then mark their location on your map. The visual experience gives you a singular, loud and clear command to <i>explore</i>.

    The landscapes feel appropriately adventurous, with each zone being a previously inhabited biome that enemies have now made into a stronghold. Eastward is a lake; westward is a forest full of crystals; and northward is a freezing mountain. The south zone,
    a desert much more challenging than the other three, only opens up once the bosses of the other three zones are defeated. The variety in scenery feels like you're traveling the whole world, almost. The lengthy underground segments in every biome only strengthen the feeling of a classic dungeon crawl.
    Another good example of hailing, actually, is the elevator taking you down into each dungeon.

    This is all plainly visible in most of the footage on this page, but the particular kind of adventure is focused thanks to the score, composed by Disasterpeace. This is a snippet of the overworld track in the west zone, "The Midnight Wood":

    This is one of the more intense overworld themes. Except for the relatively rare cutscenes and bossfights, the music tends to remain relatively calm, even during combat. Exploration is the number one motivator.
    The music swells a lot more when the player takes in the view near the top of a mountain than when they kill a room full of plant monsters.

    The gameplay drives the player forward <i>almost</i> as much as the sights and sounds do. It's smooth and satisfying. In the overworld, it kind of takes a backseat to the pretty pictures and incredible score, but in the dungeon, the game is two things: a brawl and a treasure hunt.
    This footage doesn't properly demonstrate what combat looks like once you have a few cool abilities, but even in the early game, longer fights are a flash of blades and bullets that requires a healthy dose of improvisation.

    The other half of the gameplay loop, the "treasure hunt" as I called it, is a cornucopia: money, game lore, modules necessary for progression, keys to secret areas, and new outfits. You're never somewhere you shouldn't be, and there are always more corners to poke around in.
    On top of all this, the sound design makes every inch of the journey viscerally satisfying.

    <i>Hyper Light Drifter's</i> adventure is tactile. Every step, slash, and shot is heard and felt by all. The player takes the role of an adventurer, and both the journey <i>and</i> its destination provide a satisfying reward.
    The reason that I chose to talk about this game is that it doesn't do any singular thing <i>new</i> per se, it just takes a "normal" dungeon-crawling action RPG and carries that formula as far as it will go. The result is, plainly, an adventure. (A damn good one, I think.)
