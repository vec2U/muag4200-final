    This paper is about the game <i>Hyper Light Drifter,</i> developed by Heart Machine and released in 2016. I love this game to death, not least because of its landscape and soundscape. I never really nailed down what's so appealing about it to me,
    and what's driven me to uncover every little secret inside it when I'm usually not a completionist at all, until very recently. Upon being greeted with the world a third time when I started a new playthrough for this class, I realized it was <i>adventure.</i>

    This is one of the first things you're greeted with after the opening cutscene and the tutorial. It shows you the town in the distance, but more importantly it lets you feel what it's like to <i>be a brave warrior standing on the edge of a cliff looking off into the distance.</i>
    You almost feel heroic, even before you've really started the game!

    After a killer cutscene where you're plagued by visions and rescued by a mysterious helmed hero, you wake up in their house and subsequently walk out into town. It's all a very cliched-sounding beginning of a hero's journey.
    The town is peaceful, and the buildings you can visit consist mostly of the shops where the inhabitants will sell you things later. Again, not a very creative-sounding setup! It's all in the sights and sounds that the game makes that conventional journey into a memorable experience, an <i>adventure.</i>
