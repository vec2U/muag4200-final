    This paper is about the game <i>Hyper Light Drifter,</i> developed by Heart Machine and released in 2016. I love this game to death, not least because of its landscape and soundscape. I never really nailed down what's so appealing about it to me,
    and what's driven me to uncover every little secret inside it when I'm usually not a completionist at all, until very recently. Upon being greeted with the world a third time when I started a new playthrough for this class, I realized it was <i>adventure.</i>

    This is one of the first things you're greeted with after the opening cutscene and the tutorial. It shows you the town in the distance, but more importantly it lets you feel what it's like to <i>be a brave warrior standing on the edge of a cliff looking off into the distance.</i>
    You almost feel heroic, even before you've really started the game!

    After a killer cutscene where you're plagued by visions and rescued by a mysterious helmed hero, you wake up in their house and subsequently walk out into town. It's all a very cliched-sounding beginning of a hero's journey.
    The town is peaceful, and the buildings you can visit consist mostly of the shops where the inhabitants will sell you things later. Again, not a very creative-sounding setup! It's all in the sights and sounds that the game makes that conventional journey into a memorable experience, an <i>adventure.</i>

    The game "hails" the player, as Althusser would say, in a plethora of ways, some very obvious and others more subtle. The region where you start the game leads you into a tutorial, which directly tells you what your controls are, but more importantly,
    the game indirectly signals that you are entering into a heroic video game escapade, and thus any prior video game escapades will apply. The town is full of shops; any walls blocking your path will have arrows on them telling you to "go that way first" or boxes telling you to "collect this many keys";
    interacting with a fellow traveler causes them to show you what the boss of the region looks like and then mark their location on your map. The visual experience gives you a singular, loud and clear command to <i>explore</i>.
    You're never somewhere you shouldn't be, and there are always more corners to poke around in.

    Talk about the sights and sounds here; add footage from the west and east

    Combat drives the player forward just as much as the sights and sounds do.
