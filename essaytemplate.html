<br>I think if I had to pick any one game to talk about in an essay format, it'd probably be Hyper Light Drifter. There's a lot to talk about with regard to its atmosphere as well as its very cool factor-focused gameplay.</br>
<br>That said, I'm not sure what aspects of a game we're going to be talking about in our final paper, so if we're supposed to be talking about a game story we really like or something, I might pick something that's more in-depth in that field, like Arknights.</br>
